# libzm

I'm compiling a core set of functionality for simple DOM access, 2D and 3D files and data into a set of files.
I started this to have a common set of my own code to use in my browser-based game projects.

Built in TypeScript, builds against TS 1.6 or newer, just run `tsc` somewhere inside the project dir.

* Some simple DOM utils
* Promise-based async file loads
* Simple keyboard input
* Read TMX data from Tiled
* Some 3D types and generators

This will expand over time as I build more games and identify useful shared functionality.
