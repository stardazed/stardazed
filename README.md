# Stardazed TX

A library to enable quick development of custom 2D and 3D games in the browser.<br>
Sibling of and proving grounds for [Stardazed](https://github.com/zenmumbler/stardazed), my native C++ game library.

Built in TypeScript, builds against TS 1.6 or newer, just run `tsc` somewhere inside the project dir.

Current features:
* Some simple DOM utils
* Promise-based async file loads
* Simple keyboard input
* Read TMX data from Tiled
* Some 3D types and generators

Over time I want to get SD-TX and SD to share most of their functionality while still being programmable in
a way native to their platforms.
